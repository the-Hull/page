## Alex, who?

I am an early-career researcher at the [University of Birmingham](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk) under [Dr Nick Kettridge](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/kettridge-nick.aspx) and [Prof Stefan Krause](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/krause-stefan.aspx). I mostly spend my days working toward the completion of my [PhD]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/research/), but I sometimes find enough time at my disposal to dive into other subjects. My interests are manifold and are reflected in my skill set, which I continuously strive to expand. Working with people from a variety of fields and backgrounds in collaborative or teaching environments has always been a great joy.

## Science, what?

I am aspiring to be engaged in innovative, collaborative and inter-disciplinary research in the field of ecohydrology and applied ecology, allowing for evidence-based decision-making. With my [research]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/research/) in particular, I wish to delineate ecosystem processes and how they relate to the socio-ecological domain.

Science, I believe somewhat romantically and idealistically, is a truly altruistic endeavor, where one strives to elucidate the workings of our environment, thereby constantly pushing the boundary of the unknown - for the benefit of our (and hopefully fellow) species. Communicating new insights is therefore a fundamental necessity, which I aim to achieve via reproducible and transparent data science products that are easily accessible for anyone.
